## Description:
Ajali is an application developed by a team of professional software engineers designed to revolutionize emergency response. Utilizing React JS for the frontend, Python, Flask, SQL, and SQLite3 for the backend and database, Ajali streamlines the emergency reporting process, ensuring prompt assistance when needed.

With Ajali, users can seamlessly sign up and log in within seconds, enabling them to quickly report incidents. The application automatically captures the geolocation of the incident location, eliminating the need for manual input. Upon submission, administrators receive real-time notifications, allowing them to swiftly assess the situation and dispatch appropriate resources.

Ajali's robust technology stack ensures seamless operation, rapid incident reporting, and efficient emergency response coordination, making it an invaluable tool for communities seeking enhanced safety and well-being.
